                  <p> Clash of Clans is a freemium mobile strategy 
                    video game developed and published by Finnish
                     game developer Supercell. The game was released
                      for iOS platforms on August 2, 2012, and on Google 
                      Play for Android on October 7, 2013. The game is set
                       in a fantasy-themed persistent world where the player 
                       is a chief of a village. Clash of Clans tasks players to
                        build their own village using the resources</p>

                  <h5>2019-2021</h5>
                  <p>The C++ language has two main components: a direct 
                    mapping of hardware features provided primarily by 
                    the C subset, and zero-overhead abstractions based 
                    on those mappings. Stroustrup describes C++ as "a 
                    light-weight abstraction programming language [designed]
                     for building and using efficient and elegant abstractions";
                      and "offering both hardware access and abstraction is 
                      the basis of C++. Doing it efficiently is what distinguishes 
                      it from other languages."</p>
